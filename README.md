# 2-wheel-balancing
Arduino sketch, just for fun.

This project relies on my [arduino-easy-serial library](https://github.com/sebgiles/arduino-easy-serial) and on the MPU-9250 library found [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/IMU_10DOF).

Lego Frame, single NXT Motor for convenient gearing, L298N double H bridge module, GY-91 10DOF sensor module.

Robot is currently tethered with USB cable and 9V DC power line, as soon as I can get it to work I'm going to cut the cables and add esp8266-wifi module as UART bridge and batteries to allow it to run free.
